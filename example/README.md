# Building the example app
1. Make sure you have the [React Native for Windows development dependencies](https://aka.ms/rnw-deps)
1. Clone this repo
1. `cd react-native-xaml`
1. `yarn`

# Running the example app

## Using Visual Studio
1. `cd example`
1. `yarn start`

Now you can build and run the solution in **Debug** mode at `example\windows\example.sln` from Visual Studio by pressing F5 (make sure you select x64 or x86).

## Using the CLI

If you want to use the `react-native` CLI you can run `yarn windows`.
